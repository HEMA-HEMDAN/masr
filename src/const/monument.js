    fullDescription:
      "The Temple of Khonsu, nestled in the southwestern corner of the Karnak temple complex in Luxor, dedicated to the moon god Khonsu, a significant deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. Construction began under the reign of King Rameses III on the ruins of an earlier temple from the 18th Dynasty. Over time, the temple was enhanced, particularly during the reign of King Nectanebo II and the Ptolemaic period."
      +"This temple exemplifies the classic design of ancient Egyptian religious structures. Measuring approximately 73 meters in length and 29 meters in width, it comprises a series of architecturally distinct sections. Visitors would first encounter the outer gateway, or pylon, which opens onto a processional avenue flanked by sphinx-like statues. Although time has reduced these statues to their bases, they remain a testament to the craftsmanship of King Nectanebo I during the 30th Dynasty. Beyond the pylon lies the first courtyard, a square hall bordered on three sides by rows of round columns with capitals shaped like closed papyrus buds."
      +"From this courtyard, a passage leads to the Hypostyle Hall, a structure featuring eight columns arranged in two rows. The columns’ capitals alternate between closed and open papyrus buds, adding visual interest to the hall. This section, dating back to the reign of King Seti I, is thought to include remnants of the earlier temple. The Hypostyle Hall transitions into a rectangular chamber that once housed the Sanctuary, now largely destroyed. Remarkably, a sandstone statue of Khonsu, believed to date to the reign of King Tutankhamun, was discovered here. Beyond this chamber is the Sacred Boat Shrine, a smaller room supported by four columns. At its center lies the base for Amun’s sacred boat, from the era of King Rameses III."
      +"Significant modifications to the temple were undertaken by later rulers. King Nectanebo II rebuilt the gateways of the Hypostyle Hall, while the Ptolemaic rulers extensively renovated and expanded the structure, incorporating stones from the older temple into their designs."
      +"Khonsu, as part of the Theban Triad alongside Amun-Ra and Mut, held a revered place in Egyptian belief. Representations of Khonsu often depict him as a child with a distinctive side braid or as a robed figure holding a scepter, crowned by the full moon resting on a crescent. His association with the moon imbued him with a reputation as a healer and protector, capable of expelling evil spirits—a trait that ensured his enduring popularity..",

       +"It consists of the first pylon, which is a large building facing four flagpoles, while the inner one competly inscriped with the famous Battle of Kadesh. This pylon follows the first courtyard, which is currently demolished, and has two rows of columns on its southern side, while on the northern side there was a row of Osirian columns. As for the second pylon, to the left there are the remains of a huge black granite statue of Ramses II. The second courtyard is higher than the first one, but it is also demolished and has rows of columns and Osirian columns. After that comes the Hall of Columns with six rows of columns."
       +"The temple is surrounded by many chapels dedicated to various deities, in addition to other buildings such as bakeries, kitchens, warehouses."
       +"The entire complex is essential to understand the importance of Ramses II in Egyptian history and to admire one of the most important moments in Pharaonic architecture and art."
       +"The walls of the Ramesseum were decorated with prominent banks depicting the king fighting his enemies in the Battle of Kadesh, in addition to depicting religious and funerary ceremonies and rituals."
       +"It was also designed with its majestic columns and its huge statues, including the statue of Ramses II, which is more than 17 meters high and weighs about 1000 tons."
       +"This complex was not known until the 18th century, that Frederick Ludwig Norden described the ruins. Later, the scientists who accompanied the expedition of Napoleon's army between 1798 and 1801 would also document the site. In 1829, it was visited by Champollion, who gave it the contemporary name of Ramesseum. ",

It was dedicated to performing his funeral rituals, as well as to performing the rituals of worshiping the god Amun. This temple was built according to the usual traditions of temple construction in this era and is largely inspired by the Ramesseum."
       +"King Ramses III (c.1184-1153 BC) is the most famous king of the Twentieth Dynasty, who fought many wars against the Libyans and the Sea Peoples, which led to years of prosperity in Egypt, but in the end, he fell victim to a conspiracy by the royal harem in the late days of his reign."

The eastern gate leads to the first pylon, then the first courtyard, then the second pylon and the second courtyard, then three halls of columns and a group of chapels, then the Holy of Holies and behind it a group of rooms. The temple also includes the remains of a royal palace, storehouses, temple administration buildings, and royal stables. It also contains many columns, some of which are round with papyrus-shaped capitals, and others represent Ramses III in the form of Osirians."
       +"There is also in the area surrounding the temple a temple built by Queen Hatshepsut and King Thutmose III on the site of a temple built in the Twelfth Dynasty, which was built on the tombs of the ancestors of the god Amun, as well as the tombs of the divine wives of the god Amun-Ra, which date back to the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Dynasties."
       +"There was a canal connected to the Nile, preceded by a dock. This canal allowed access to the temple by boats. The temple is surrounded by a huge wall built of mud bricks with two guard rooms. The area surrounding the temple was used by the inhabitants to protect themselves from attacks by Libyans from the west and to protect the temple. This is due to the political situation during the reign of Ramses III."
       +"The decorations of the temple show Ramses III in military scenes such as the Libyan campaigns and battles against the Sea Peoples, as well as scenes of hunting and exploratory trips, in addition to religious scenes such as the king worshipping the deities, as well as various celebrations.",

It is divided into two sections; northern enclosure, an area reserved for military activities. Salah al-Din commenced its construction in AH 572 / AD 1176 and work was continued by his brother and successor king al-Adil. The southern enclosure of the citadel, which had more ceremonial and residential functions was completed during the reign of Salah al-Din’s nephew, king al-Kamil. It consists of a cluster of buildings surrounded by walls that follow the irregular topography of the site with towers and doors. These massive walls and towers were constructed with limestone."
      +"Most of the towers of the Citadel of Salah al-Din are situated in its northern enclosure. 18 tower some of which built during the reign of Salah al-Din are distinguishable by their semicircular shape, often enlarged in their diameter by al-Adil. Towers built entirely during the reign of al-Adil are rectilinear in plan. Within the towers are rooms on multiple levels that lead to perimeter embrasures for discharging arrows upon potential beseigers. Among these towers are al-Muqattam tower, Burg al-Suffa ('Alignment' Tower), Kirkilian tower, al-Turfa tower, Burg al-Muballat (‘Paved’ Tower), Burg al-Muqusar (‘Pavilion' Tower), Burg al-Ramla (‘Sand’ Tower), Burg al-Haddad (Blacksmith’s Tower), Burg al-Matar (‘Flight’ Tower used for pigeons), Burg al-Alwa (‘View’ Tower) and the Burg al-Sahra (‘Desert’ Tower). In addition, two towers named al-Imam flank the Bab al-Qarafa (Cemetery Gate)."

The tower is built of limestone with a diameter of 22 metres and a height of 21.70 metres. It was originally built in a semicircular shape which was changed to a round-fronted design by an addition made by the Sultan al-Adil (AH 596-615 / AD 1200-1218)."
      +"The tower has two floors and the original interior plan of Salah al-Din consisted of a central groin-vaulted space with three embrasures leading to arrow slits. These arrow slits were converted into doorways by Sultan al-Adil that led to a semi-circular curving corridor from which five further rectangular vaulted halls radiated to the exterior of the tower on both the ground and upper floors. The exterior walls have machicoulis -  projecting windows from which liquids such as burning oil could be thrown on attackers from above."

It has two floors, each floor consisting of a central hall with three radiating vaulted chambers extending to the perimeter. Each chamber has a splayed narrow window embrasure through which weapons could be discharged."
      +"During the reign of Sultan al-Adil (AH 596-615 / AD1200-1218) the tower was expanded, and the window embrasures of each of the three radiating chambers were converted into door openings leading to rectangular vaulted rooms that ended in arrow slits. A corridor within the curtain wall of the enclosure connects the Burg al-Ramla with its immediate neighbour, the Burg al-Haddad (the ‘Blacksmith’s Tower’).  ",

    fullDescription:
      "The first king of the 4th Dynasty, Sneferu (c. 2613–2589 BC), chose Meidum as the site of his royal tomb. What we see today bears little resemblance to the original monument, which was a step pyramid that was then transformed into a true pyramid with smooth sides."
      +"For this and several other reasons, Sneferu’s reign was a pivotal point of the Old Kingdom, and the site of Meidum is an integral part, representing the developments in pyramid-building know-how, technology, and techniques that would then lead to the building of some of Egypt’s most famous monuments."
      +"At Meidum, Sneferu began building a seven-step pyramid that would have been 65 metres high. This was then enlarged, possibly before completion, into an eight-step pyramid. These two phases are called E1 and E2 by Egyptologists. In a completed state, the E2 pyramid would have been 85 metres high with a base length of 120.75 metres. It was at this point that Sneferu built the massive Bent and Red Pyramids at Dahshur. He then transformed the eight-step E2 pyramid into a true pyramid (E3) which stood between 92 and 95 metres high, with a base length of 144 metres."
      +"Today, the pyramid has the appearance of a three-step structure emerging out of a massive mound of rubble and debris surrounding it. This tower is, in fact, most of the core of the pyramid. It was previously hypothesised that the rubble was the result of a sudden and catastrophic collapse that took place during the E3 construction phase. However, the debris consists of layers—strata—demonstrating that the erosion and destruction of the pyramid was, in fact, gradual."
      +"According to earlier scholarship, the Meidum pyramid was constructed by Sneferu’s predecessor, the last king of the 3rd Dynasty, Huni (c. 2637–2613 BC). This is no longer the consensus. Sneferu’s name appears in texts in Meidum, and the ancient name of this site was Djed Sneferu ‘Sneferu Endures.’ During the reign of Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC) in the 18th Dynasty, the scribe Ankhkheperreseneb visited Meidum and wrote an inscription, saying that he had come ‘to see the marvellous temple of Horus Sneferu. He saw it, as if heaven were in it and in it the sun rose.’"
      +"The Interior of the Pyramid"
      +"The entrance into the pyramid is in its north face, as was the standard, but it is unusually around 15 metres above the ground. A descending passage goes from the masonry of the pyramid down into the bedrock, turning into a horizontal corridor. Going past two niches, this leads to a vertical shaft that goes up to the burial chamber. Its corbelled ceiling distributed the tremendous weight of the masonry above, preventing it crushing the open spaces within the pyramid. It is for this same reason that the ancient Egyptians built corbelled weight-relieving spaces just above the two niches and the lower part of the descending passage. These were only discovered in 1998. It is here in Meidum that corbelling for a stone ceiling appears for the first time, a technique that would later be used to outstanding effect in the Grand Gallery and the burial chamber in Khufu’s tomb—the Great Pyramid.

Initially, the palace consisted of the Saraya al-Ekama (Residential Palace), Saray al-fasqiyya (Fountain Palace) and saray al-gabalaya. It also included a bird tower, boat harbour, Hydraulic wheel (Saqqyia) that provided the palace and its garden with water, and stables known as the Shubra Stables."
     +"The style employed in the palaces took on the character of 19th century Italian and French aesthetics. This was also the first building in Egypt to incorporate a modern lighting system, when Muhammad Ali Pasha commissioned the English engineer Galloway to install lighting fixtures in the palace."
     +"The palace underwent extensive restoration and was reopened in 2005, after which it witnessed several important events, providing a wonderful location for receiving official delegations. After 2011 it remained closed, but given its historical and artistic value, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, in cooperation with the Armed Forces Engineering Authority resumed restoration and development plans in 2018. The restoration work included floors and walls, raising the efficiency of the picturesque lake, restoring and maintaining inscriptions and decorations, in addition to linking the palace to the Nile pier for ease of movement for visitors ",

The project revealed a group of 78 tombs from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BC) belonging to men, women, and children. Their genders and ages suggest that a settlement existed in the location of Gebel al-Silsila, rather than a temporary housing site for quarry workers as previously thought."
     +"These simple tombs are undecorated rock-cut chambers that contained vessels, beer jars, faience beads and scarab amulets, bronze bracelets, and animal bones. The tombs were covered by the accumulation of sand over centuries and their state of preservation is poor due to heavy erosion and the rising water table. The excavation, preservation, and study of these tombs and their contents is important for our understanding of this unique site. ",

Agriculture in ancient Egypt was only possible thanks to the fertile soil deposited during the flood, and the kings acknowledge how the inundation, addressed in the form of the god Hapy, brings life to the Egyptian people.

Although an earlier temple once stood here already during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BC), the present structure was built during the Graeco-Roman Period (332 BC–395 AD), with the earliest attested royal name in it being Ptolemy VI Philometor’s (180–145 BC). Most of the decoration was completed by Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos (80–51 BC)."
      +"The temple has a unique design. Because it is dedicated to two gods, it has two parallel axial passages running through its columned halls, terminating in two sanctuaries, one for each. The southern axis (on the right) is Sobek’s, and the northern (on the left) Harwer’s."
      +"Sobek was a god of fertility associated with water, the inundation, and vegetation, worshipped here alongside his wife the goddess of love and motherhood Hathor and their son the moon god Khonsu. The god of kingship Horus is the son of Osiris and Isis and, as Harwer, he is in adulthood, victorious over Seth, the murderer of his father. He was worshipped here alongside his wife Ta senet nefret ‘The Perfect Companion’ and their son Pa neb tawy ‘The Lord of the Two Lands’."

Calendars list festivals and other cultic activity, along with their dates and accompanying rituals. During the Roman Period, in the 2nd century AD, a scene was carved featuring what are believed to be surgical instruments, demonstrating how sophisticated ancient Egyptian medicine was. In the centre of the very back of the temple, Sobek and Harwer can be been on their respective sides of the temple in a deeply symbolic scene, inspiring awe in ancient pious visitors to this sacred place."

The country is gripped in seven years of drought and famine and King Djoser summons his famous courtier, the wise Imhotep to find a solution. Imhotep told the king that the inundation came from the sacred spring in Elephantine Island, whose god Khnum was the one who controlled the flow of water. Djoser dutifully made offerings to the gods of Elephantine and Khnum appeared to him in a dream one night, promising him to end the famine by returning the flood.

      +"The Unfinished Obelisk was discovered in the early twentieth century after it had been covered by sand for thousands of years. It remains as you see it today in one of the Aswan quarries, famous for its supply of hard and high-quality stone. Believed to have been commissioned by Hatshepsut (c. 1473–1458 BC) for the temple of Amun in Karnak, work was abandoned because of flaws in the stone and the presence of multiple fissures. Had it been finished, it would have weighed 1168 tonnes, and stood at a height of around 42 metres, taller than any other ancient Egyptian obelisk. ",

      +"At the far end of the temple is the sanctuary, where the cult image of the god was kept. A partly rock-cut chapel to the Nubian god Dedwen lies to the south-west, and a small chapel, likely built by Ptolemy IX in the 2nd century BC, is located to the north-east."
      +"Multiple cultures have left their mark on the temple of Kalabsha, from its dedication to a Nubian god to its inscriptions in Meroitic and Greek. The slender columns and their wide spacing hint at influence from Graeco-Roman tradition. There are several crosses carved onto its walls, signaling the beginning of Christianity in the region when the sanctuary was used as a church."

Because of the red bricks that make up most of its masonry, it is known as the Red Monastery. White limestone was employed in the building’s construction as well as were several pink and black granite columns."
     +"The monastery was founded by Saint Bishoy in the beginning of the fourth century AD, but suffered of two fires, the first was during the Roman Period, and the second was as a result of Berber attacks."
     +"All that remains of the Red Monastery is its church and surrounding fortification walls to the south. Remains of a structure north of the church also survived and are thought to belong to an industrial area."

At 143.5 meters in height, however, his pyramid is only slightly shorter, and a tremendously impressive monument. Its core masonry is made of blocks of local limestone. The top of the pyramid still preserves the beautifully polished blocks of high-quality limestone that once encased the majority of the structure’s towering height. This white stone was quarried in Turah, south of Maadi, and transported here by ship."
     +"The mortuary temple of Khafre at the foot of his pyramid and the valley temple at the end of the causeway are larger than any of those of older pyramids, and also among the best preserved of the Old Kingdom. Another development in the reign of Khafre is the complexity of their layout, with the elements constituting his mortuary temple becoming the new standard that its later Old Kingdom counterparts would follow. A unique feature of Khafre’s complex is the inclusion of a colossal statue beside his valley temple the Great Sphinx. The valley temple is made of massive limestone blocks encased in granite, floors made of alabaster, and its wide hall features monolithic granite pillars.      "
     +"The symmetrically arranged niches along the walls of the hall once accommodated statues of the king, some of which are currently on display in the Egyptian Museum. One of these, the famous granodiorite statue of Khafre with Horus as a falcon perched behind his head, is widely considered one of the masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.  ",

The Great Sphinx and the temple in front of it, called the Sphinx Temple, lie directly next to Khafre’s valley temple and the lower portion of the causeway leading up to his mortuary temple and pyramid.

With a base area that is less than a quarter of their pyramids’, and with an original height of 65 meters, Menkaure’s is by far the smallest of the three. This reduction in size is due to several factors, including the limited amount of space left on the Giza Plateau. The material used for the outer casing of Menkaure’s pyramid is another. Whereas his predecessors had used limestone for this purpose, Menkaure employed granite, which was quarried in Aswan, over 800 km away. In addition to the logistics involved in transportation of the granite blocks, the material itself is much harder than limestone. However, only the bottom quarter of the casing stones are made of granite however, the rest being limestone."

His mortuary and valley temples were intended to consist of colossal limestone blocks encased in granite, but were actually completed with whitewashed mud brick.

Low-ranking overseers of workmen were buried in modest mastabas on the low slopes of the hill, surrounded by even smaller mastaba or domed tombs, possibly those of their extended families and the workers they supervised. These were largely built of mudbrick, whereas the higher-ranking overseers and skilled craftsmen were buried in large stone mastabas higher up the slope. Among these is the beautifully decorated tomb of the overseer of linen, the overseer of the royal house of purification, Nefertheith. The majority of the bodies discovered show evidence of hard physical labor, many even featuring broken bones. Most of these had healed correctly, however, indicating that, in addition to being well-fed, the workers also received very good medical care.  ",

It constitutes a significant historical turning point in ancient Egyptian funerary monuments, revolutionizing stone architecture and royal burials. In addition to its beauty and monumental scale, it is not only the very first pyramid that the ancient Egyptians ever built, but also the oldest known ancient Egyptian stone structure."

    +"Before his reign, royal and elite Egyptians were buried in mastabas. This word, meaning “bench” in Arabic, refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The Step Pyramid is composed of six stacked mastabas, thus creating the stepped effect. Imhotep, its architect, may very well have been responsible for this major innovation."

The two courts in front of the pyramid recreate the setting of the Sed Festival, a royal ceremony aimed at rejuvenating the king and regenerating his power.

Upon completion, it stood 52.5 m tall. Although it was originally encased in blocks of fine limestone, its core consists of small blocks of local limestone and debris fill. This meant that, when the casing blocks were removed in antiquity, the core, unable to sustain its shape, began to droop. The pyramid appears little different from a natural hill today as a result. Its substructure, however, is intact."

Three magazines for burial equipment lie on the left, but since the pyramid was robbed in antiquity, these were found empty. On the right, west, side is the burial chamber. Its ceiling is decorated with gold stars against a dark blue background, reflecting the ancient Egyptian notion of the tomb as a microcosm of the universe. The end of the corridor, and the entirety of the antechamber and burial chamber are beautifully decorated with Pyramid Texts. These are a collection of rituals and recitations that were designed to ensure the king’s successful journey to the afterlife.
