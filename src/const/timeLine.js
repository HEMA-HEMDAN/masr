    fullDescription:
    "This period covers all of ancient Egyptian prehistory, from the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), down to the end of the Neolithic (New Stone Age). Strictly speaking, “prehistory” refers to the phase of a culture before it had writing. In Egypt’s case, writing appears at around the same time as the end of its Stone Age, around 3100 BC. This is also when Egypt as a unified political entity came into being, making it the world’s oldest nation state.            Before the formation of the first Egyptian state, during the Neolithic Period, an increasing homogenization of the different cultures that had emerged along the Nile Valley can be seen. Cultures are named after their sites of origin. Some of the most important of these are the Maadi Cultural Complex (c.4000–3100 BC) in Lower Egypt, near Cairo; Badarian culture (c.5500–4000 BC) near modern Asyut in Middle Egypt; and, most importantly Naqada I (c.4000–3500 BC) in Upper Egypt, near Luxor.            Naqada I culture, like its contemporaries, initially displays little in the way of social stratification, but this changes towards the end of this period. This trend became more pronounced during Naqada II (c.3500–3200 BC), which began to spread along the Nile Valley. Among the most important Naqada II sites, aside from Naqada itself, were Hierakonpolis (Kom al‑Ahmar), near Edfu, and Abydos, both in Upper Egypt. During Naqada III (c.3500–3100 BC), society continued to grow more complex, and differentiated itself from contemporary Nubian culture, eventually separating itself from it politically. The transition from Naqada III to the Early Dynastic Period was a smooth one. For this reason, Naqada III is sometimes also called “Dynasty 0”.          The powerful chiefs of this final period appear to have already been in control of most, if not all, of Egypt. Upper and Lower Egypt were geographically different, and the two had remained distinct until late in prehistory, and the ancient Egyptians never forgot this fact. Thus, when Egypt eventually became united as one political entity under a single ruler, the ancient Egyptians, throughout their entire history, referred to their king as the “Lord of the Two Lands”."

    fullDescription:
    "Ancient Egyptian history before the Graeco‑Roman Period is called the Dynastic Period, which is divided into 30 dynasties. The Early Dynastic Period begins with the unification of Egypt into a single political entity around 3100 BC, and consists of the very first two dynasties.The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt was in reality a very gradual process, but one of its final stages appears to have taken place during the reign of King Narmer. One of the most important treasures in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, the Narmer Palette, is a record of his historic event. With the unification of Egypt, a new capital was founded: Memphis. Then known as Ineb‑Hedj “The White Wall”, this new city, situated between—and thus uniting—Upper and Lower Egypt, would remain one the country’s most important and populous cities throughout ancient Egyptian history.The area of Abydos (near modern Sohag) retained its prominence from the preceding Naqada III period. The kings of the First Dynasty were buried here, and their tombs demonstrate a tremendous leap forward in monumentality. Egypt was becoming more centralized, and the king’s power was growing. Most of the Second Dynasty rulers were buried in Memphis, but the last two, Kings Peribsen and Khasekhemwy, had their final resting places constructed in Abydos. Tantalizing clues suggest a power struggle between them. This may have been echoed in the stories revolving around the gods Horus and Seth, but this is far from certain. Royal power grew demonstrably during the reign of Khasekhemwy. Like his predecessors, he paired his tomb with a funerary enclosure closer to the Nile Valley. This truly massive structure, today known as the Shunet al‑Zebib, far surpassed any of those of his predecessors, however, and remains one of the world’s oldest surviving brick structures."
